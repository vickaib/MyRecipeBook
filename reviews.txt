1. My name is Jane Doe, and I'm reviewing the Raspberry Macarons. They're fresh, fruity, and perfect for any regal occasion. When I made them for the first time, I had a really hard time whipping the merengue to be the perfect consistency. Additionally, making sure that the dough isn't over-mixed is so difficult! I think the recipe isn't the problem, and is mainly the use of practice. Overall, this is a very delicious and a decently easy recipe to follow along with. I'm looking forward to more!
