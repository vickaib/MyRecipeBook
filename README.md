# MyRecipeBook

## Description
Created a mockup of a recipe log of recipes that I enjoy, allowing users to search through the recipe names. The project was based on an assignment and aligned with its requirements, including submission forms, autofill capabilities, and alerts. 

## Challenges
- Styling of the page is outdated
- Many images no longer load or follow inactive links
- Use the spoonacular API to retrieve recipe names and images to display on page rather than just storing in data.json
